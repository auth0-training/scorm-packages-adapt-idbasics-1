They would like customers to be able to create accounts so that they can easily check out with saved information. Their primary goal is to implement a seamless signup and login experience in order to minimize friction. In addition, they would like to source customer identities from multiple providers including social login via Google and Facebook. That way, their customers can easily use an existing account instead of the hassle of creating a new one just for their site. Finally, they want enhanced security with multi-factor authentication and attack protection.",
